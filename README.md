# click2boxes

This was started as a way to right click on two boxes over and over on a private server in World of Warcraft.
It then ballooned into the version that it here. This one automatically turns on my recording software for the
time of the clicking.

Things to improve:
  -more interaction at launch (example: how many times to click each box, 360 is about an hour)
  -recording yes/no option
