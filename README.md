# click2boxes 1.0

This was started as a way to right click on two boxes over and over on a private server in World of Warcraft.
It then ballooned into the version that it here. This one automatically turns on my recording software for the
time of the clicking.

Thge first click into the World of Warcraft window is at 800x800 in your screen. 
Once there place the cursor over the first box and wait for the "ding" noise.
Then more it to the second box and wait for the "ding" noise again.
Then just sit back and wait for the 720 clicks to complete.
This should get lockpicking to ~100 and takes an hour and 8 minutes on my test.


Things to improve:
  -more interaction at launch (example: how many times to click each box, 360 is about an hour)
  -recording yes/no option
  -track correct window usage
